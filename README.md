# Blog-Project
Internship Blog Project

This is a simple Blog created using HTML,CSS and JS. I wanted to keep things simple.

## How to run the Application
This is a dockerized application like asked and so to run it by runnning the command below:

`docker run hassan547/blog-project`

### Something to know
This application has a backend built with express JS. The Website has an 'editor' which is very minimmalistic, and allows you to upload a banner image together with the title and content of the blog. Once publish is hit, the newly created blog will be saved to the database. The blogs saved in the database can be accessed with a little tweaking of the code, but since I didn't see a lot of relevance in the given project I have left them out.
